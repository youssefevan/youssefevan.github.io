            Collecting and Exploring 5,000 Steam Reviews of Starfield

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This dataset is comprised of 5,000 Steam user reviews of the game Starfield.
            The data will be analyzed to determine the differences between positive and
            negative reviews. These differences will be measured using the data associated
            with each review, which can be found on the
            <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/getreviews">Steamworks Documentation</a>.
            By default, the Steamworks API filters "off-topic" reviews that are a result
            of review bombing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using this data, I aimed to answer the question:
            What are the different characteristics of positive and negative Steam reviews?
        </p>

        <p>
            For reference, here is my
            <a href="project1_files.zip" download>
                Jupyter Notebook and the full dataset
            </a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Collecting Data</h2>
        <p>
            Based on
            <a href="https://andrew-muller.medium.com/scraping-steam-user-reviews-9a43f9e38c92">
                this guide by Andrew Muller</a>,
            I scraped 5,000 of the most recent Steam reviews for the game Starfield.
            I selected the game Starfield because it is a recent, high-profile game
            with a good balance of positive and negative reviews. However, this code
            can scrape any number of reviews from any game on Steam by inputting the
            AppID into the <code lang="language-python">get_n_reviews()</code> function.
            This function will return a JSON file of all n reviews and their fields.
            The fields of each review can be found on the
            <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/getreviews">
                Steamworks Documentation</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Cleaning Data</h2>
        <p>
            At this point, the data cleaning process had already begun in the data
            collection phase. When scraping the data, I was able to set multiple
            parameters through Steamworks. For example, I had excluded any non-English
            reviews and reviews from people who had received the game for free. The
            rest of the data cleaning process was fairly trivial because of this.
            Since Steamworks autogenerates the metadata for each review, the data was
            well-structured and free of null values. Furthermore, I flattened subfields
            into their own column when converting the JSON to a CSV for easier parsing.
        </p>

        <p>
            To finish the cleaning process, I dropped any fields that were redundant,
            such as the <code>language</code> field, or irrelevant, such as the reviewer's SteamID.
            I was able to narrow down the number of fields from 22 to 7.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
        <p>
            I used boxplots, scatterplots, and word clouds to visualize and derive
            patterns from the data. I categorized the data visualizations into three
            groups: interaction data, author data, and review data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each review has the following fields:<br>

            <code>voted_up</code>, where <code>True</code> indicates a positive review
            and <code>False</code> indicates a negative review;<br>

            <code>votes_up</code>, indicating the number of users who like the review;<br>

            <code>weighted_vote_score</code>, which represents the user-rated "helpfulness"
            of the review on a weighted scale;<br>

            <code>num_reviews</code>, indicating the number of reviews that the author has
            written (with game per review);<br>

            <code>playtime_at_review</code>, indicating the number of minutes the author
            had spent in Starfield at the time the review was posted.

        </p>

        <h2>Interaction Data Visualizations</h2>
        <p>
            This category includes fields that represent how other users interacted with
            each review. In this category, I compared <code>votes_up</code> and 
            <code>weighted_vote_score</code> to whether a review was positive or negative.

        <h2>Author Data Visualizations</h2>
        <p>
            This category includes fields that represent the author of each review.
            In this category, I compared <code>num_reviews</code> and
            <code>playtime_at_review</code> to whether a review is positive or negative.

        <h2>Review Data Visualizations</h2>
        <p>
            This category is comprised of the words in each review. I compared the
            most used words in negative reviews to most used words in positive reviews.
        </p>
        <p>Positive reviews:</p>
        <img src="../assets/project1/pos_cloud.png" alt="Positive reviews word cloud">
        <p>Negative reviews:</p>
        <img src="../assets/project1/neg_cloud.png" alt="Negative reviews word cloud">

        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The interaction data visualizations show that negative reviews are generally
            more interacted with than positive reviews. Both the median 
            <code>weighted_vote_score</code> and number of <code>votes_up</code> are higher
            in negative reviews. This speaks to Starfields' mixed-to-negative reception
            from the Steam audience. However the difference in median <code>weighted_vote_score</code>
            is much smaller between positive and negative reviews than the median number of
            <code>votes_up</code>. Negative reviews appear to get far more <code>votes_up</code>
            than positive reviews. The scatterplot also shows this difference, illustrating
            that positive reviews are more likely to receive a higher <code>weighted_vote_score</code>
            than a high number of <code>votes_up</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The author data visualizations show that reviewers who post negative reviews
            are more likely to have posted reviews from many other games. This could illustrate
            that people who are more critical of a game's quality are more likely to speak up
            about their experience.
            This data also reveals that, as expected, reviewers who
            reviewed Starfield positively played more of the game at the time of review.
        </p>
        <p>
            The words in the positive review word cloud that stuck out to me were "story",
            "combat", "weapon", and "explore". These could indicate what reviewers most
            enjoyed about the game. However, I also noticed the word "issue" was present
            in the word cloud. This may reveal that reviewers were willing to acknowledge
            some of the game's shortcomings while still praising its strengths.
            Some of the more interesting words in the negative review word cloud include
            "loading screen", "Bethesda game", "Fallout", and "Skyrim". The first phrase,
            "loading screen", seems to be alluding to a common critique of Starfield's frequent
            use of loading screens to transition between sections of the game. It seems that
            this use of loading screens is a common issue for detractors of the game. The other
            three phrases, "Bethesda game", "Fallout", and "Skyrim" refer to the game's developer
            and their previous successful IPs. It seems that negative reviewers could be comparing
            Starfield to some of Bethesda's more well-received games such as The Elder Scrolls V:
            Skyrim and some of the games from the Fallout series.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion and Impact</h2>
        <p>
            While I think that, overall, the correlations in this dataset are relatively weak, I think
            that more interesting results can be found with more advanced methods. I imagine that the
            reviews themselves could be used to train a machine learning algorithm to classify and
            summarize reviews. However, this hypothetical algorithm would need to be carefully tuned
            so as to not mislead consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think it is important to take these results with a grain of salt. Especially in the case of
            the word clouds, it is easy to make unjustified conclusions about Starfield and its reception.
            For example, I needed to understand the context of Bethesda and their games to understand why
            negative reviews mentioned Skyrim and Fallout so often.
