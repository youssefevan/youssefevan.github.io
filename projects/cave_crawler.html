            My first published video game was Cave Crawler, which was
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865440/Cave_Crawler/" target="_blank">
                published on Steam
            </a>
            in January of 2022. The game recieved over 100,000 downloads and
            earned 95% positive reviews. I created and published the game as
            a part of my high school graduation project.

            Since then, I have competed in multiple Game Jam competitions,
            and have created several small projects that are all published on
            <a href="https://evan12811.itch.io/" target="_blank">Itch.io.</a>
        </p>

            Currently, I am working on a sequel to Cave Crawler that features
            a custom level editor along with new levels, enemies, and boss fights.
            You can view the source code on 
            <a href="https://github.com/youssefevan/cave-crawler-2" target="_blank">Github.</a>
            I am aiming to publish Cave Crawler 2 on Steam in 2024.
