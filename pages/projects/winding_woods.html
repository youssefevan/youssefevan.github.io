            Winding Woods is a game I made with a friend for the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/jam/2023-spring-game-jam/rate/2032526">
                Spring 2023 UNCC Game Jam.</a>
            <br><br>
            The game was inspired by the Lost Woods from the Legend of Zelda. Each room has exits in
            four directions. One of those directions brings the player to the next room, one
            to the previous room, and one that loops back to the current room.
            <br><br>
            As the lead programmer, I coded the player movement, combat, enemies, and room looping system.
            To create the "lost woods" mechanic, I created each rooms as seperate scenes. I assigned each
            room an ID number and set progression and regression directions. When the player exits the
            camera, the game checks which room needs to be spawned based on the direction, then spawns an
            instance of the room with the correct ID.
            <br><br>
            The main point of contention between my teammate and I was the NPC dialogue. We both wanted
            to include an NPC that could talk to the player, but we disagreed on what the NPC should
            say. I wanted the NPC to give cryptic hints at which direction the player should go so the
            player didn't have to rely on trial and error. However, the dialogue system was causing
            problems and my teammate didn't have time to write all of the hints so we agreed to make
            the dialogue more vague and mysterious. This experience was a good excercise in conflict
            resolution. We didn't have time to argue about the game and had no playtesters to backup
            our perspectives, so we had to agree to disagree and focus on finishing the game.
            <br><br>
            The game is not perfect but I ultimately like how it came out. It was fun designing
            the room progression system and I think the game emulates the feeling of the Lost Woods
            pretty well. It has a couple notable bugs and I still there is too much trial and error
            when navigating, but I think we nailed the mystic and strange atmosphere that we aimed
            to achieve.
