            Cave Crawler is my first
            <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865440/Cave_Crawler/">Steam</a>
            release and was created as a part of my high school graduation project. I released the game
            on January 23rd, 2023. Since launch, the game has earned 95% positive reviews
            and over 100,000 downloads.
            <br><br>
            Cave Crawler is the first game that I developed to completion, and the development process
            taught me a lot about project management. Before this point in my game development journey,
            I had spent many years making prototypes and half-finished projects but could never commit to
            developing an entire game. However, since my graduation project had a hard deadline, I
            finally gained the motivation to complete a game. Through completing Cave Crawler, I learned
            how to direct my motivation towards achieving a goal.
            <br><br>
            Although the game is small in scope, I am proud of how it turned out, and I'm grateful for its
            generous reception on Steam. Being my first finished game, the game has a lot of flaws, especially
            within the code. I tried my best to address the game's problem in
            <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000490/Cave_Crawler_2/">Cave Crawler 2</a>,
            which I released in October of 2024. I think the sequel illustrates how much I've grown as a developer
            in the past few years, and I'm excited to work on more long-term projects in the next few years.
