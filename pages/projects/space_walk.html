            <br>
            Space Walk is a game I created during the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/jam/2022-fall-49er-game-jam/rate/1780971">
                Fall 2022 UNCC Game Jam.</a>
            <br><br>
            Space Walk was my first-ever game jam entry and was completed in under 2 days. Since I was
            new to game jams, I decided to focus on a very simple gameplay system to avoid extensive bug
            fixing. While my inexperience at the time showed through the rudimentary UI and menus, I'm
            proud of what I was able to accomplish.
            <br><br>
            In Space Walk, the player launches an astronaut around planets and their gravitational pulls.
            The astronaut must orbit each planet in a level in order to complete the mission. The
            player has three charges to launch the astronaut, which recharge when the astronaut enters
            a planet's field of gravity. After orbiting each planet, the player must guide the astronaut
            to the space station.
            <br><br>
            When designing the game, I wanted the player to be able to make intentional, calculated
            decisions while sometimes including quick, improvisational choices in reaction to the
            physics system. There are two design choices that contribute to these feelings: momentum
            and limited charges. 
            <br><br>
            The astronaut's momentum is taken into account when the player
            launches them in a direction. For instance, when inside a gravity field, the astronaut
            will get launched further if the player aims in the same direction that the astronaut
            is orbiting. Having limited launch charges forces the player to calculate when and
            where to launch the astronaut. If the player launches the astronaut at the wrong time,
            in the wrong direction, or with the wrong amount of power, they can get stuck inside
            of a gravity field. These two mechanics work together to create a push-and-pull effect
            between the player's intentions and reactions.
